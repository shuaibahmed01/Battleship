## About

This object oriented Battleship project uses fundamental and advanced Python skills to put together the commonly played game Battleship. This code works by creating multiple objects that are integral aspects of the game such as the players, the ships, the board, and the game itself and puts each objects role together to make a smooth game design. The program can take in any dimensions that the user inputs for the size of the board, the number of ships the user wants each player to use, and of course the orientation of each players ship to create the boards. It then goes through the processews of the game until a winner is decided by destroying all the opposing players ships. 

## User Requirements

The program requires the user to first input a path to a CSV file with game specifications in order to get the program started.
